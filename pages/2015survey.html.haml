%h1 2015 Ruby Australia Developer Survey

%blockquote
  The founding purpose of Ruby Australia is to further the use and adoption of the Ruby programming language in Australia, and to support and encourage a vibrant community around the language and related technologies.

%p
  This year the Ruby Australia committee has really ratcheted up the effort in delivering on our founding idea - furthering the use and adoption of Ruby in Australia. We have three independent but interlinked efforts being worked on right now: growing the number of developers joining our community, easing the operation of the Ruby events that occur in Australia, and finally engaging our partners in industry in providing a robust commercial future for Ruby in Australia.

%p
  To support our efforts in promoting Ruby to both developers and potential employers of developers we need to build our case on a strong foundation of data. How many Ruby developers are there in Australia? How many potential employers are in the market? What depth of experience exists in the community right now? Where do Ruby developers even live? This survey is designed to help us answer those questions and more to the wide variety of people who can help us drive further adoption of Ruby.

%p
  If you've written anything more than a handful of Ruby code in any capacity this year we'd really appreciate it if you could take five minutes out of your day to tell us a bit about yourself and your work situation. We'd appreciate it <em>even more</em> if you could help us get this survey in front any Ruby developers you know that might not ordinarily see this. The more complete a picture we have of who you all are, the better the job we can do advocating on your behalf.
