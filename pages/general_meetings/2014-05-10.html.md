# Ruby Australia General Meeting Minutes
**10th May, 2013**

**Meeting open: 5:00pm**

## Agenda

### 1. Opening statements

Pat Allan opens the meeting.

Pat's just the narrator, no official power.

The eight Committee members currently are:

1. Matt Allen (*President*)
1. Josh Price (*Vice-President*)
1. Jason Stirk (*Treasurer*)
1. Luke Chadwick (*Secretary*)
1. Lachie Cox (*General member*)
1. Elle Meredith (*General member*)
1. John Barton (*General member*)
1. Dylan Lacey (*General member*)

### Treasurer's report - Jason Stirk
The accountant has highlighted a problem with the report.

Matt (current president) has been given access to the bank accounts. This is primarily for redundancy.
A discussion is needed in the committee about whether the incoming VP is also given access.

The Balance sheet has been done up to 31 March. Jason reports that we are still in a very health position.

It has been identified that the Camps should not be running a profit. They are for the members.

Moved: Dylan
Seconded: Noel
Outcome: Motion passed without dissent.

### RubyConf Report - Steve Gilles
The organizers are very happy about the event. The venue was a great success.

This could not have happened without Ruby Australia.

Decision was made to not make too much profit. The RailsGirls event was free.

Moved: Pat
Seconded: Craig
Outcome: Motion passed without dissent.

### VP's Report - Josh Price
Greetings from not so sunny Sydney!

It's been another successful year for Ruby Australia supporting the Ruby community in Australia. It's a wonderful community and I'm extremely proud to be a part of it.

Together we've shipped some amazing events: another fantastic Rubyconf, 2 amazing Railscamps, a host of wonderful RailsGirls events, and all of the various meetups that happen around Australia.

Most importantly I'd like to thank everyone who's helped to make these events possible as well as all of the committee members past and present. Untold hours of behind the scenes work goes into making these events possible. So if you see an organiser, don't forget to say thanksâ€¦ :)

It certainly feels to me like our community has grown more diverse, and more vibrant and this should be celebrated.

Thanks everyone, have a great Railscamp!

Cheers,
Josh

PS: I nominate Pat Allan to replace me as Vice President of Ruby Australia in absentia

 Moved: Pat
 Seconded: Luke Parndt
 Outcome: Approved, No Dissent

### Pat's report on upcoming events

- Next RailsCamp will be held in Perth.

- The location for RubyConf 2015 has been selected. It will be held at the Deakin Edge Theatre in Melbourne.
